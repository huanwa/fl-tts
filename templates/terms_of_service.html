                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Before using the services, please read these terms of service carefully. 
                    Your access to and use of the services is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these terms. 
                    These terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the services. 
                    By accessing or using the services, you agree to be bound by these terms. 
                    If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not be able to access the services.</p>

                    <h2>Our Services</h2>
                    <p>LuvvoiceÂ® offers a state-of-the-art AI voice creation technology and online platform. 
                    You simply type or paste in the text you want to convert to speech, and Luvvoice will produce an audio file with a lifelike voice that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as videos, podcasts, and presentations. 
                    We offer a range of voices and languages for you to choose from, as well as the ability to adjust the speed, pitch, and volume of the voiceover. 
                    You have complete ownership of the audio files you create, and the content with which you create the audio files.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Obligations</h2>
                    <p>By using the services, you confirm that you meet the following conditions: (a) you are at least the defined minimum age; (b) you only have one Luvvoice account that uses your real name; and (c) you have not been previously restricted from using the services by Luvvoice. Using false information or creating multiple/duplicate accounts is a violation of our terms, including creating accounts for others or for those under the minimum age. "Minimum Age" means 16 years old. However, if the law requires that you must be older for Luvvoice to lawfully provide the services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data), then the minimum age is such older age. You agree to: (a) use a strong password and keep it confidential; and (b) not transfer any part of your account. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or immediately report misuse. Your account belongs to you and not to others, including your employer. However, if the services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., corporate accounts), the paying party has the right to control access and receive reports on your use of the paid services, but does not have rights to your personal account.</p>

                    <p>Between you and Luvvoice, the content and information that you submit to the services belong to you. However, you grant Luvvoice a transferable license to use, copy, modify the following account details such as full name, email, and billing details, without any further consent, notice, or compensation. The rest of your data is stored in encrypted format, with end-to-end access only belonging to you. Because you own your content and information, and we only have non-exclusive rights, you can choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license. You and Luvvoice agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information and personal data that you provide in accordance with the terms of our privacy policy and our security policy, as well as your specified choices and settings.

The following remain effective after termination: our rights to use and disclose your feedback; disclaimers and limitations of liability, arbitration, class-action waiver, and jury waiver, applicable law and dispute resolution, and parts of the user agreement; and any amounts owed by either party prior to termination remain owed after termination.</p>

If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our discretion. By continuing to access or use our services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the services.</p>
